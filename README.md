#### Project was made based on my classroom exercicies

<h1 style"align-text=center;"> Project: Balanced Binary Tree </h1>
 A project about Data Structure based on Tree Model with balance.
 
## What I use?

I use Python and:
  In python i use the following libs:
    <ul>
      <li> drawtree (to print Tree) </li>
      <li> chronometer (to get time per instruction) </li>
      <li> random (to generate random numbers and insert they on tree) </li>
    </ul>
    

## What I do?



## What a Balanced Binary Tree have different compared to a Simple Binary Tree?

</p>

<p align="left">
  A Balanced Tree can improve a search on Tree making it more faster with some rules:
    <ul>
      <li> Left side and right side of the Tree need to have same height or in maximum one Node of difference in height (height its referenced by root of the Tree)</li>
      <li> If some side is more high, is doing a balance of Tree </li>
      <li> The balance involve passing Nodes from highest side to the lowest side (right or left) up until they have a maximum of one Node of height of difference or equal (You can see this on example image above)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

  A Binary Tree without Balance which contain much insertions can spend so much time on a search, while a Balanced Tree can do it so much faster when have same height on sides
