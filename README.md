#### Project was made based on my classroom exercicies

<h1 style"align-text=center;"> Project: Balanced Binary Tree </h1>
 A project about Data Structure based on Tree Model with balance.
 
## What I use?

I use Python and:
  In python i use the following libs:
    <ul>
      <li> drawtree (to print Tree) </li>
      <li> chronometer (to get time per instruction) </li>
      <li> random (to generate random numbers and insert they on tree) </li>
    </ul>
    

## What I do?



## What a Balanced Binary Tree have different compared to a Simple Binary Tree?
